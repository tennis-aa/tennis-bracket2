- elo perform much better than the median robot. Why? Can we adapt the strategy of the robot?
- create the functions to load and save the brackets from the database (instead of a method of pybracket, this could a function in the app)
	- create a mechanism to update the results
- create a data base with players with more than one first name to scrape for atpwebsite
	- create database of names that are not exact matches in atp vs elo websites for scraping elos
- find a way to update results through an admin interface and to schedule updates
- instead of a registration page have a username and password change page
- restrict submission to before start time of the tournament
- interface to do eloscrape from the user side
- can selenium look for geckodriver on the folder (the geckodriver must match the os of the server)
	- there is a way to install chromium on the heroku app, maybe also gecko driver
- use utr as an alternative to elo?
